# Divide and Conquer

#### Counting Inversion
  * **Input**: n distinct number a1,a2,....,an
  * **Outout**: number of pairs that with i < j but ai > aj.
  * Example:

    | 3 | 9 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 1 | 7 | 8 |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

  There are 11 inversion pairs in this example : (3,2),(3,1),(9,2),(9,4),(9,6),(9,1),(9,7),(9,8),(2,1),(4,1),(6,1)
  * Using divide-and-conquer Algorithm:
    Try to break the problem into two halves:
    * We can count the number of inversion in the first  half as well as the second half
    * It remain to count the number of inversions with one number in the first half and the other number in the second half,these **cross** inversion pairs are easier to count,because we know their relative positions and we just need to count how many are they
    * Observe that we can determine this infomation when we merge the two sorted list as in merge sort.When we insert a number in the second half to the merged list, we know how many numbers in the first half is grater than it, as in merge sort,this can be done in O(n) time
      
    First merge
    | 3 | 9 | 2 | 4 |
    |---|---|---|---|

    | 6 | 1 | 7 | 8 |
    |---|---|---|---|

    Second merge

    | 3 | 9 |
    |---|---|

    | 2 | 4 |
    |---|---|

    | 6 | 1 |
    |---|---|

    | 7 | 8 |
    |---|---|

  * Pesudo Code:
   ```
   count(A[1,n])                                                T(n)
    if n =1,return
    count(A[1,n/2]                                              T(n/2)
    count (A[n/2+1,n])                                          T(n/2)
    sort(A[1,n/2])                                              O(nlog(n))
    sort(A[n/2+1,n])                                            O(nlog(n))
    merg-and-count-cross-inversions(A[1,n/2],A[n/2+1,n])        O(n)
  ```
  Totoal running time is T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(nlog(n))  ===> T(n) = Î˜(nlog(n))
